        <h3>Creativity</h3>
        <p>Brainstorming, especially over coffee, is a treat for me. 
          I try to approach problems knowing that more than one solutution 
          can exist. Often nature and craftsmanship from the past are sources
          of inspiration to me.</p>

        <h3>Wire-framing & prototyping</h3>
        <p>I approach wire-framing and prototyping from the perspective 
          that 'less is more'. Sites and apps should be easy for the user to navigate
          and intuitive to understand. My favorite tools are Figma, Miro, and InVision.</p>

        <h3>Project Management</h3>
        <p>I am a planner and logically-minded by nature, so Project
          management comes easily to me. In my latest project, I facilitated 
          daily stand-ups and assigned task according to team member effieciencies.</p>
